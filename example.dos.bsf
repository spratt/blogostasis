Example Title

Example blurb goes here to provide a preview of the blog post in a few
words.  <strong>May contain HTML markup!</strong>

<p>The example blog post would be here.</p>

<p>Notice that the first line (everything preceding the first newline
mark) in this file is the string which will be appended to your blog
url to retrieve the blog post.  That is, if your blog's url is
simondavidpratt.com/blog.html, then to access this post the url would
be simondavidpratt.com/blog.html#example-url </p>

<p>The second line is a space separated list of tags which can be used to
index your blog posts.</p>

<p>The third part (beginning with the third line) is the title string of
the blog post.  This may span several lines.  Every line after the
first will be a subtitle.  The end of the title is marked by two
newlines.</p>

<p>The fourth part is the blurb, which is a summary of your blog post to
be used whenever it is useful to give a preview of your post without
showing the whole post.  This may span several lines, and the end of
the blurb is marked by two newlines.</p>

<p>The final part is the actual blog post, which also <strong>May contain
HTML markup!</strong></p>
